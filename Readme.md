For the backend, create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory and define required variables such as `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and Firebase credentials.  
Start the backend server using `npm start`, then navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm run dev` to launch the client application.
